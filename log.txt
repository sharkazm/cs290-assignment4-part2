Tasks: Performed final error checking on site. Found error where if I "checked out" a movie within a search window of a specific genre it went back out to all movies, corrected the error, did some styling on site and concluded project was finished. Double checked requirements page and performed required actions. Detected one final error where the dropdown list contained a blank rea when the Toy Story test was run. Corrected it, program appears to meet all prerequisites.
